Visual Rhetoric Backstory: 

For my visual rhetoric project I decided on making an ironic car ad. I've always loved cars and even car ads and wanted to try my hand at creating something entertaining and interesting. More will come in my reflection of the project, but as of now my thought process was originally to work an old Honda Civic into an image of a trailer park, but then decided to go another route and to do something even stranger. I decided to put the car in space after the earth explodes, you gotta see it to believe it. All of the images were ethically obtained and I believe that the project turned out rather well. The final draft is the one labeled "car add", the other two were my working drafts. Have a nice day.
